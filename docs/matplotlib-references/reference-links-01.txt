===========================================================
Matplolib : It is a Python plotting library, inspired by MATLAB, meaning that the terms used (Axis, Figure, Plots) will be similar to those used in MATLAB.

    import matplotlib 

PyPlot : It is a shell-like interface to Matplotlib, to make it easier to use for people who are used to MATLAB.

    import numpy as np
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	
Pylab: Someone had the idea of combining both the PyPlot and NumPy namespaces into a single one (to avoid having to import two namespaces), the result is PyLab. Using Pylab is now discouraged.

	from matplotlib.pylab import *
